# Aircraft Data Dashboard - Tableau Project
This project showcases an interactive Tableau dashboard that visualizes aircraft-related data. The dashboard integrates two datasets (ba_reviews.csv and countries.csv) and provides insights into key metrics and trends. This project is designed to help users explore and understand aircraft data, including reviews and country-specific information, through a visually engaging dashboard.

## Dashboard Overview
The dashboard is built using Tableau and includes the following features:

* **Aircraft Reviews:** Insights from ba_reviews.csv, which contains review data for airlines, showcasing metrics such as review scores, sentiment, and airline performance.
* **Country Data:** Information from countries.csv, offering details about the countries where these airlines operate, including regional analysis and distribution of reviews.

The dashboard allows users to explore key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends, making it easier to analyze aircraft and airline data based on different perspectives.
